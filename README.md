#  Convex

Student project where I had to work with geometry abstraction named convex.
You can enter points to expand the convex. Program draws the figure and prints its current perimeter and area.
The first point you enter isn't a part of convex.
Program will sum distances between this point and convex points powered by 2 (this was my personal task).
